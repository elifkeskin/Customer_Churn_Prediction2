**Project Name:** Telco Customer Churn Analysis

**Project Description:**

Churn analysis is a method used by companies to predict which customers are more likely to abandon their service.

**Project Purpose:**

Developing strategies to increase customer satisfaction and reduce customer loss by analyzing customer churn.

**Dataset:**

Each row represents a customer, each column contains customer’s attributes described on the column Metadata.

**The data set includes information about:**

Demographic info about customers – gender, age range, and if they have partners and dependents


**Libraries We Will Use:**

**tensorflow:** It is an open source deep learning library.

**scikit-learn:** It is an open source machine learning library.

**numpy (Numerical python):** It is a library that allows us to work with multidimensional arrays and matrices and to perform numerical operations quickly.

**pandas:** It is a powerful data analysis and manipulation library.

**matplotlib:** It is a data visualization library.


**Project Steps:**

**1.**  We will first load and review the dataset.

**2.**  We will pass the dataset through preprocessing steps.

**3.**  We will choose a model architecture on the dataset and build the model.

**4.**  We train the model.

**5.**  We  visualize and evaluate the model.
